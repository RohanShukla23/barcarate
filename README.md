## API Endpoints

### Squad Endpoints
- `GET /api/squad` - Get current Barcelona squad
- `GET /api/squad/analysis` - Get detailed squad analysis

### Player Endpoints  
- `GET /api/players/search?query={name}&position={pos}&team={team}` - Search La Liga players

### Transfer Endpoints

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Backend (.env file):**
```
PORT=3001                    # Server port (default: 3001)
FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_key    # API-Sports API key
NODE_ENV=development         # Environment (development/production)
```

### API Configuration

The application uses the API-Sports football API. Key endpoints:
- Player search and statistics
- Team squad information
- League data for La Liga (ID: 140)
- Barcelona team data (ID: 529)

### Frontend Proxy

Add to `frontend/package.json` for API proxy:
```json
{
  "proxy": "http://localhost:3001"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 3001 already in use:**
   ```bash
   # Find process using port
   lsof -i :3001
   # Kill process (replace PID)
   kill -9 PID
   # Or use different port
   PORT=3002 npm run dev
   ```

2. **API key issues:**
   - Verify your API key is valid
   - Check API usage limits
   - Ensure proper environment variable setup

3. **CORS errors:**
   - Backend includes CORS middleware
   - Verify frontend proxy configuration

4. **Mock data mode:**
   - App automatically uses mock data when API fails in development
   - Check console for API error messages

### Development Tips

- Use `NODE_ENV=development` for mock data fallbacks
- API requests are logged in console for debugging
- Player search requires minimum 2 characters
- Transfer evaluations consider El Clasico rivalry factors
