## Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Flask backend with API endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dist/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.html    # Single-page frontend application
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # This file
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/squad` - Get current Barcelona squad
- `GET /api/players/search` - Search La Liga players
- `POST /api/transfer/rate` - Rate a potential transfer
- `GET /api/squad/analysis` - Get squad analysis and weaknesses

## How Transfer Rating Works

The system evaluates transfers based on multiple factors:

1. **Player Quality** (0-3 points): Based on FIFA-style ratings
2. **Age Factor** (-1.5 to +1 points): Younger players get bonuses, older players get penalties
3. **Value for Money** (-2 to +1 points): Expensive players relative to ability get penalized
4. **Squad Needs** (0-1.5 points): Players filling identified weaknesses get bonuses
5. **Rival Factor** (+0.5 points): Signing from Real Madrid gets a small bonus

Example ratings:
- **8-10**: Excellent transfer, highly recommended
- **6-7**: Good transfer with some benefits
- **4-5**: Average transfer, mixed pros and cons
- **1-3**: Poor transfer, not recommended

## Current Squad Data

The application includes FC Barcelona's 2024-25 squad based on the provided roster, including:
- Goalkeepers: ter Stegen, Joan GarcÃ­a, SzczÄ™sny
- Defenders: AraÃºjo, Balde, KoundÃ©, Cubarsi, Christensen, and more

## La Liga Player Database

Currently includes 20+ players from major La Liga teams:

- AtlÃ©tico Madrid (Griezmann, Morata, etc.)
- Real Sociedad (Oyarzabal, Zubimendi, etc.)
- Athletic Bilbao (Nico Williams, Sancet, etc.)
- And more teams...

## Development

### Adding Players
To add more players to the database, modify the `LA_LIGA_PLAYERS` list in `app.py`:

```python
{"name": "Player Name", "age": 25, "rating": 85, "value": 50000000, "position": "ST", "team": "Team Name"}
```

### Customizing Analysis
The transfer rating algorithm can be modified in the `calculate_transfer_rating()` function in `app.py`.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Flask-CORS
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Axios
